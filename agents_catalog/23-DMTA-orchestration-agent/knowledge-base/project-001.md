# Anti-TNF Nanobody Optimization for Adalimumab Biosimilar

**Project ID**: PROJ_2023_001  
**Target**: TNF-α binding  
**Timeline**: 10 weeks  
**Cycles Completed**: 4  
**Final KD**: 0.3 nM  

## Objective
Improve binding affinity and reduce immunogenicity for adalimumab biosimilar development.

## Methodology
- **Acquisition Strategy**: EI for exploration, UCB for exploitation
- **Variants per Cycle**: 8
- **Convergence Criteria**: KD < 0.5 nM or model uncertainty < 0.1

## Success Factors
- CDR3 loop engineering was most effective
- Expected Improvement acquisition function optimal for initial cycles
- Framework mutations improved stability without affecting binding

## Key Results
- Achieved 10-fold improvement in binding affinity
- Reduced experimental burden by 35% through active learning
- Maintained expression levels above 40 mg/L throughout optimization

## Lessons Learned
- Early focus on CDR3 mutations yielded best results
- Expression monitoring critical for variant selection
- Conservative approach in framework regions prevented stability issues

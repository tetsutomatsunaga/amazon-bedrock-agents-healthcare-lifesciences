# Caplacizumab Affinity Enhancement Project

**Project ID**: PROJ_2022_087  
**Target**: vWF A1 domain binding optimization  
**Timeline**: 12 weeks  
**Cycles Completed**: 5  
**Final KD**: 0.4 nM  

## Objective
Enhance Caplacizumab binding affinity for improved therapeutic efficacy in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

## Methodology
- **Acquisition Strategy**: Adaptive EI with increasing exploitation
- **Variants per Cycle**: 10
- **Convergence Criteria**: KD < 0.5 nM and model confidence > 0.9

## Success Factors
- Multi-point mutations in CDR3 achieved breakthrough
- Active learning reduced experimental burden by 40%
- Gaussian Process model accuracy improved with each cycle

## Key Results
- Achieved 8-fold improvement from parent Caplacizumab (3.2 nM → 0.4 nM)
- Successful optimization through 5 iterative DMTA cycles
- Maintained excellent expression and stability profiles

## Lessons Learned
- Caplacizumab optimization benefits from larger variant pools
- Multi-cycle approach essential for significant improvements
- Model-guided design more effective than random mutagenesis
- CDR3 S101A mutation was critical breakthrough point
- Late-stage UCB acquisition function improved final optimization

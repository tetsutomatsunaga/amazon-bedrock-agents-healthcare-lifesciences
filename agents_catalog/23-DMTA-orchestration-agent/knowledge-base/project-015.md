# vWF A1 Domain Nanobody Development

**Project ID**: PROJ_2023_015  
**Target**: von Willebrand Factor A1 domain  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks  
**Cycles Completed**: 3  
**Final KD**: 0.8 nM  

## Objective
Develop high-affinity nanobody for thrombotic disorders treatment.

## Methodology
- **Acquisition Strategy**: Balanced EI/UCB approach
- **Variants per Cycle**: 6
- **Convergence Criteria**: Target KD achieved or 3 consecutive cycles without improvement

## Success Factors
- Targeted CDR1 and CDR3 mutations most effective
- SPR assays with HBS-EP+ buffer provided consistent results
- Expression yield monitoring prevented stability issues

## Key Results
- Achieved 4-fold improvement in vWF A1 binding
- Maintained high expression yields (>35 mg/L)
- Excellent specificity profile with minimal off-target binding

## Lessons Learned
- vWF A1 domain requires specific CDR positioning
- Buffer conditions critical for accurate SPR measurements
- Conservative mutation approach prevented expression failures
- Early cycle focus on CDR1 mutations established binding foundation

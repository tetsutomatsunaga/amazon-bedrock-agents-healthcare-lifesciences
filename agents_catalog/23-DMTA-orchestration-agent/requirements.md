## Use Cases

### UC1: Active Learning DMTA Workflow
**Actor**: Drug Discovery Scientist
**Goal**: Optimize FactorX using active learning approach
**Chat Conversation Flow**:

**User**: "Please create a project plan to optimize Cablivi (Caplacizumab) for improved vWF binding affinity"
**Agent**: Creates initial DMTA plan with active learning strategy, defines optimization objectives (KD < 1 nM)

**User**: "Start the first DMTA cycle"
**Agent**: Uses plan_cycle to generate initial compound set and experimental design

**User**: "Design nanobody variants for testing"
**Agent**: Uses plan_cycle to apply acquisition functions (EI/UCB) and select promising variants

**User**: "Execute the expression and testing"
**Agent**: Generates FactorX dummy data for expression/SPR assay phases, simulates experimental results

**User**: "Analyze the results and recommend next steps"
**Agent**: Uses analyze_results to update Gaussian Process model, identifies best variants, recommends next cycle

**Iterative Process**: Continues until convergence criteria met or optimal nanobody variant found

### UC2: Multi-Cycle Optimization
**Actor**: Medicinal Chemist
**Goal**: Achieve target properties through iterative cycles
**Steps**:
1. Review Gaussian Process model predictions
2. Apply acquisition functions for next compound selection
3. Generate FactorX SPR binding data
4. Update model with new results
5. Assess convergence and binding optimization progress
